# MinD-Webs-Site
Old site of MinD Webs.  

This is basically the source code for the official MinD Webs site that was live until 2nd October 2019. This was created 1.5 years prior to that date.  
Anyone willing to suggest changes to the current site hosted at [MinD Webs](https://mindwebs.org) can add up a different pull request and generate various features that can be implemented with the new design.  
  
### What Changes can be made?
Dynamicity to the current design with additional modified css for different elements. This may not have any relation to the current repository that contains the old files of MinD Webs Site.
  
  
Thank You
